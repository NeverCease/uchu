## Origin

> Where did these colors come from?

High-level: looked at the Wikipedia page for Crayola colors, selected my favorites, put a filter over them in Affinity Designer, made more edits (have to research my notes to figure out details), and eventually landed at these color stops.

It took a long time to settle on yellow/orange because I've never been able to get a good yellow I was happy with, specifically.



## Normal colors

> Where's the HEX codes?

The point of this palette is to move away from HEX codes. If you need/want them in your own projects, feel free to fork.



## Dark Mode

> This site doesn't respect my dark mode preference so I left!

It's not about "respect," I never implemented a dark mode.

> A well thought out palette would have all the things

👍🏾



## The name

> Why the name uchū?

"uchū" means "universe" in Japanese. I use this theme for all of my projects so...universal.

I can't speak to anything else but personally, I love Japan style/aesthetic/whatever so I'm gonna use a word if it fits.

> As a non-Japanese person, **I** think that **YOU** shouldn't just pick Japanese words for your project

...okay

> ACKHTUALLY it doesn't mean "universe," it's closer to "space"

My apologies for not being fluent in the Japanese language.

I didn't look deeper than [WordHippo](https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the/japanese-word-for-244fb75b19415c9ee4f143b34b4b241236fb63f5.html) for translation.

> Typical American, taking things that don't belong to you. Get bent.

(I never responded to this and this person deleted their comments twice to get even nastier)



## Virality

> Why is a page full of color codes on the front page?

Beats me, I just wanted to share something cool I made.

> These colors aren't even good

...okay?

> If you present something to Hacker News, it better be professional and this is subpar. I don't even know what uchū means.

My bad?



## The tagline

> This title is clickbait! It annoys me!!

I don't understand...

> You don't know how words work!!

You got it man.

> You have failed to show the relationship between "the internet" and "love." In what sense is this theme for internet lovers?!

😳

> EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THIS THEME IS FOR SELF-PROFESSED INTERNET LOVERS

It's not that deep bro
